<h3>Fun Facts About Rust</h3>

</div>

Broken Elevator Inspiration

> The language's creator, Graydon Hoare, started Rust in 2006 partly out of frustration with a broken elevator in his apartment building, which sparked his interest in safer concurrent programming.

OCaml Roots

> In its early days (2006–2009), Rust's compiler was implemented in about 38,000 lines of OCaml code before transitioning to self-hosting on LLVM by 2012.

Evolving Keywords

> Early Rust syntax used two-letter keywords like re for return. Some were dropped, but classics like fn for functions survived the culling reflecting a minimalist design that was refined over time to improve readability.

Fungal Namesake
> Rust is named after the group of fungi that cause rusting on plants described by Hoare as "over-engineered for survival," mirroring the language's robust safety features.

Bicycle Logo Origins
> The Rust logo, introduced in 2011, is inspired by a bicycle chainring, symbolizing the interlocking gears of safe, concurrent code.

Nerd Cave Development
> Mozilla's early Rust team worked in a conference room nicknamed "the nerd cave," complete with a sign on the door, starting from a small group in 2009.

Forgotten Features
> Rust once had an explicit obj keyword for object-oriented programming and a typestates system to track variable states—both were removed during simplification efforts between 2012 and 2015.

Edition System
> To handle evolution gracefully, Rust releases "editions" every 2–3 years with limited breaking changes (e.g., making await a keyword), and crates from different editions interoperate seamlessly via automated tools.

Old-School Influences
> Rather than reinventing the wheel, Rust draws from obscure 1970s–1990s languages like CLU, BETA, and Limbo, with Hoare calling it "technology from the past come to save the future from itself."

Servo Was Rust’s First Big Playground
> Servo, a next-gen browser engine, was a proving ground for Rust. Many language features were stress-tested by Servo’s development.

Crab Community
> Rust users call themselves "Rustaceans" (a pun on crustaceans), and their mascot is Ferris, an orange crab who's starred in official docs and error messages since the early days.

Energy Surprise 
> A 2017 [study](https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf?utm_source=rust_bytes) found Rust code uses just 3% more energy than C but 34% less than C++, making it a sneaky efficient choice for green computing.

Abandoned Features
> Rust once experimented with an obj keyword for object-oriented programming and a typestate system to track variable states, both of which were scrapped between 2012 and 2015 to streamline the language.

Most Loved Language Champion
> According to Stack Overflow surveys, Rust has been voted the “most loved programming language” for 9+ years in a row (and counting).

Rust 1.0 Landed in 2015
> Rust officially hit [stable 1.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0/) in May 15, 2015, marking the start of its journey as a production-ready language.
